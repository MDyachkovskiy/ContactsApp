<p id="description">
  
This repository contains a contacts application developed as a part of a technical interview process. The programming language used is Kotlin.
Random User Explorer is an Android application that showcases a list of users fetched from the Random User Generator API. 
It's designed to provide a seamless and interactive way to explore user data, featuring detailed user profiles, data persistence, and interaction with other apps for enhanced functionality.

**User List Display**: The app displays a list of users, showing brief information for each user including name, photo, address, and phone number. This data is fetched from the Random User Generator API.

**Detailed User Information**: Clicking on a user in the list opens a new screen with more detailed information about the selected user, providing a richer profile view.

**Data Persistence**: User data is persisted locally using SQLite database, ensuring that the information is retained across app restarts.

**Interaction with Other Apps**:
- **Email**: Tapping on a user's email address opens email apps, allowing the user to send an email.
- **Phone Number**: Tapping on a phone number initiates a phone call, making communication easy.
- **Address**: Clicking on the address opens the location in Google Maps, providing geographical context.

**Refresh Functionality**: Users can refresh the list of users manually by clicking the refresh button. This feature ensures that the app can update its data from the API on demand.

**Error Notifications**: The app provides notifications to the user in case of any errors during data loading or processing. This feature enhances the user experience by ensuring transparency in app operations.
